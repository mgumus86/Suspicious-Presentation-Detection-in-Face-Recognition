# Computer Vision with CNN â€“ CDA Project (Georgia Tech)

This project implements image classification and face detection pipelines using CNNs and OpenCV. It was developed as part of a group project during the **Computational Data Analytics** course at Georgia Tech.

## Features
- Face detection using Haar cascades
- Image processing with OpenCV
- CNN model for classification (via PyTorch)
- Google Colab integration

## Project Structure
- `CNN.ipynb`: Core deep learning model
- `pull-images.ipynb`: Image acquisition
- `push-images.ipynb`: Preprocessing pipeline
- `imagepro/`: Image storage
- `requirements.txt`: Package dependencies

This project requires Python 3.8 to run the project notebooks. 

Specific python packages are also required and can be installed using the below command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
